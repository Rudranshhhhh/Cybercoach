## Generate a COMPREHENSIVE THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

### 1. Overall Assessment
Rate awareness: Novice → Developing → Proficient → Expert → Elite

### 2. Human Bias Heatmap
Analyze susceptibility to each psychological trigger:
- AUTHORITY: X% vulnerable
- URGENCY: X% vulnerable  
- SCARCITY: X% vulnerable
- CURIOSITY: X% vulnerable
- FEAR: X% vulnerable

### 3. Zero-Day Threat Forecast
Based on their weaknesses, predict FUTURE attack vectors they're most vulnerable to:
- Deepfake Vishing (AI voice impersonation)
- Quishing (QR code attacks)
- AI-Synthesized Spear Phishing
- Collaboration Tool Attacks (Slack/Teams)
- Business Email Compromise 2.0

### 4. Adversarial Analysis
Explain how a sophisticated attacker would specifically target THIS user.

### 5. Personalized Defense Protocol
3-5 specific countermeasures based on their vulnerability profile.
