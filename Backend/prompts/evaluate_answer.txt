## The Scenario
{scenario}

## Attack Metadata
- Correct Answer: {correct_answer}
- Manipulation Type: {manipulation_type}
- Psychological Trigger: {psychological_trigger}
- Attack Vector: {attack_vector}
- Red Flags: {red_flags}

## Student's Response
Answer: {user_answer}

## Your Analysis Task
Evaluate the student's response with focus on PSYCHOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY mapping.

### If INCORRECT:
1. Identify which psychological bias was exploited
2. Explain WHY this trigger worked on them (cognitive psychology)
3. Map to their vulnerability profile
4. Predict what future attacks they'd fall for

### If CORRECT:

2. Note which red flags they likely spotted
3. Reinforce the psychological resistance they showed
